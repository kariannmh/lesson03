            She will be graduating in December 2021. She is an intern for R&L Triangle Team and does
            freelance logo and advertisement design on the side. Kariann enjoys drawing with her hands
            and likes using a drawing tablet connected to her mac in illustrator. Kariann has discovered 
            since she has been in school that she is very naturally inclined with Photoshop and has found 
            that Photoshop tends to be her tool of choice. She is proficient in the Adobe Suite, has 10+ 
            years experience in customer service, and is a very fast learner. </p>

      <!-- ********************  ABOUT ME  ********************* -->
      <div class= "content-wrap"> <section class="aboutme">
        <h2>About Kariann</h2>  <br>
        Born in Newport News, Virginia, Kariann spent her childhood moving around between Virginia,
        Texas, and North Carolina. This taught her how to not only be really adaptive but how to also
        make friends fast and overcome many adversities. Kariann loved art and drawing from a young
        age. In Middle School Kariann discovered her love for computers. She started at her first
        fun attempt at coding by creating and modifying her own myspace layouts, and widgets
        on her page. When myspace died, Kariann went searching for other ways to satisfy her 
        coding itch but it would never work until she was a graphic design student in college.
        Kariann originally went to ECU for Biology with the idea of being an orthodontist.
        She did this because she had good grades and was pressured into going to college for
        something that she could get a job for. Everyone had high expectations of Kariann and
        had always told her since she was small that the only job you could get as an artist
        would be an art teacher. Kariann made it through a couple of years at ECU and then
        decided to take a break from school because she wanted to do something she was
        passionate about. It was during this break that she met a gentleman in the graphic
        design program at Pitt Community College. After thorough investigation and research,
        Kariann decided that she was in love with the idea of being a graphic designer.
        She spent a semester finishing her prerequisites and applied to Wake Technical
        Community College. Kariann completed a semester of the graphic design program and 
        then took a break from school for a year and a half. Kariann got married to her 
        wonderful partner and they had a precious baby boy in April 2020. Kariann's
        life changed forever after becoming a mother, she knew that she needed to finish
        school and follow her passions so she could not only provide but also inspire her
        son to overcome adversity and work hard the same way she would. Kariann has been back
        in the graphic design program for 2 semesters and is working hard towards graduation
        in Decemebr 2021.<br></div></section>
