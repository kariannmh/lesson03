        <h1>Kariann Hernandez</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>Born in Newport News, Virginia, Kariann spent her childhood moving around between Virginia, Texas, and North Carolina. This taught her how to not only be really adaptive but how to also make friends fast and overcome many diversities. Kariann loved art and drawing from a young age. In Middle School Kariann discovered her love for computers. She started at her first fun attempt at coding by creating and modifying her own myspace layouts, and widgets on her page. When myspace died, Kariann went searching for other ways to satisfy her coding itch but it would never work until she was a graphic design student in college. Kariann originally went to ECU for Biology with the idea of being an orthodontist. She did this because she had good grades and was pressured into going to college for something that she could get a job for. Everyone had high expectations of Kariann and had always told her since she was small that the only job you could get as an artist would be an art teacher. Kariann made it through a couple of years at ECU and then decided to take a break from school because she wanted to do something she was passionate about. It was during this break that she met a gentleman in the graphic design program at Pitt Community College. After thurough investigation and research, Kariann decided that she was in love with the idea of being a graphic designer. She spent a semester finishing her prerequisites and applied to Wake Technical Community College. Kariann was doing well in school but ended up being in a car accident which nearly killed her. Kariann made the selfish decision to drink and drive that night, lucky for her she was the only one involved in the accident. Kariann had swerved to avoid a Deer on the high way and ran off the road into a tree. Kariann had a brain bleed, a broken femur with the bone exposed and a completely torn knee ligament. Kariann had to take a step back from school to heal. 2 surgeries and much physical strengthening later, Kariann was back to working in a restaurant trying to catch back up on her bills. This is when her boyfriend really stepped in to help her out. Kariann started to save her money to return to school, she planned her classes for the following fall semester. A couple of weeks after she planned her classes she found out that she was pregnant. Kariann put school on hold yet again. Kariann got married to her wonderful partner and they had a precious baby boy in April 2020. Kariann's life changed forever after becoming a mother, she knew that she needed to finish school and follow her passions so she could not only provide but also inspire her son to overcome adversity and strife the same way she would. Kariann has been back in the graphic design program for 2 semesters and is working hard towards graduation in Decemebr 2021. </p>
        <p>Kariann enjoys drawing with her hands and likes using her drawing tablet connected to her mac in illustrator. Kariann has discovered since she has been in school that she is very naturally inclined with Photoshop and has found that Photoshop tends to be her tool of choice. She is proficient in the Adobe Suite.</p>
